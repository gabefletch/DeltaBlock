# DeltaBlock Security Policy

Security concerns regarding DeltaBlock and sharing NextDNS Configuration IDs have been raised by community members at [help.nextdns.io](https://help/nextdns.io). This Security Policy is designed to communicate to DeltaBlock users what level of privacy they can expect, and what they can do to ensure that this Security Policy is being maintained.<br>

## Things to Know First
**"DeltaBlock"** - The NextDNS Configuration ID:  `REDACTED`<br>
**"Gabe Fletcher"** - Creator of the DeltaBlock Configuration ID<br>
More may be added here if necessary.

## What Data is Collected
Neither DeltaBlock nor Gabe Fletcher collects any data from users. Logs are entirely disabled within DeltaBlock's setup environment. Methodology for verifying this can be found in other sections of this Security Policy.

## About Affiliation Links
The DeltaBlock GitHub repository previously included an affiliation link. This has since been removed in order to avoid causing confusion about the status of Gabe Fletcher's (@gabefletch) NextDNS account (Gabe Fletcher is the creator of the DeltaBlock Configuration ID). Gabe Fletcher pays for a monthy Pro Subscription.

## About Logs
NextDNS has the ability to save Logs of users utilizing shared Configuration IDs. Obviously, this is a security concern for users of DeltaBlock. However, the Logs feature is entirely disabled in the DeltaBlock profile settings.

## Methods of Verifying Disabled Log Status
There are two ways to verify that the DeltaBlock configuration does in fact have Logs disabled:<br>

**A - By Emailing to View the Profile**<br>
NextDNS allows giving view-only access to users via email. Unfortunately, this is the only supported method.<br>
To do this:<br>
1. Send an email to ***talk@gabefletcher.net*** with the subject: ***DeltaBlock View Request***.
2. The email address you send from MUST be the same email used for your NextDNS account.
3. You will be given view-only access to the DeltaBlock configuration (`REDACTED`).
4. Select DeltaBlock from the dropdown.
5. Go to the Logs tab.
6. You will see "No logs yet." in the space where Logs would normally appear if they were enabled.

**B - By Duplicating the Profile:**<br>
NextDNS allows users to Duplicate profiles that they add to their dashboard at my.nextdns.io<br>
To do this:<br>
1. Login to your dashboard at my.nextdns.io
2. Make sure that you have DeltaBlock selected from the configuration dropdown.
3. Go to the Settings tab.
4. Scroll to the bottom.
5. Click Duplicate.
6. Select the newly duplicated configuration from the dropdown.
7. Go to the Logs tab.
8. You will see "No logs yet." in the space where Logs would normally appear if they were enabled.
